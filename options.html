    <h2>Websites</h2>

    <p>
      Enter a list of the websites on which certain extensions should be disabled. Each
      website should be listed on its own line.
    </p>

    <p>
      NOTE: By default this extension looks for exact matches to the list of websites below.
      For example, if you enter "google.com" then this extension will only disable the
      extensions you select when you visit "google.com". If you want to disable the
      extensions on all subdomains of a website then you can use the wildcard character "*" followed
      by ".", e.g. "*.google.com" will disable the extensions on "google.com", "www.google.com",
      "drive.google.com", etc.
